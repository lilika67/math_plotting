
#### Description:
This project focuses on analyzing fuel efficiency data, including CO2 emissions, engine displacement, and other attributes related to vehicle fuel efficiency. The project aims to visualize the data through histograms and other plots to understand variable distributions and explore relationships between them.

#### Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains attributes such as:
- CO2: CO2 emissions (in grams per kilometer)
- Comb: Combined fuel efficiency (in miles per gallon)
- Displ: Engine displacement (in liters)
- Other vehicle characteristic attributes.

#### Tools and Libraries:
The project utilizes the following Python libraries:
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: For creating various types of visualizations.
- Seaborn: For statistical graphics.

#### Visualizations:
1. CO2 Emissions Distribution:
   - A histogram showcasing the distribution of CO2 emissions with a customized green color.
   
2. Fuel Efficiency Distribution:
   - Histogram displaying the distribution of fuel efficiency in miles per gallon.

3. Engine Displacement Distribution:
   - Histogram analyzing the distribution of engine displacement.

4. Correlation Heatmap:
   - Heatmap illustrating the correlation between different numeric variables.

5. Additional Analysis:
   - Pair plots, boxplots, and other statistical visualizations for deeper data analysis.

#### To-Do:
- Task 1: Create a histogram displaying the distribution of carbon dioxide emissions.
- Task 2: Plot additional histograms based on selected columns to gain further insights into data distribution.
