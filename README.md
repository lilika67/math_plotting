
**Project Summary: Fuel Efficiency Data Analysis**

**Objective**: This project aims to analyze and visualize fuel efficiency data to understand variable distributions and explore relationships between attributes like CO2 emissions, fuel efficiency, and engine displacement.

**Dataset**: The dataset includes:

CO2: CO2 emissions (grams per kilometer)
Comb: Combined fuel efficiency (miles per gallon)
Displ: Engine displacement (liters)


**Tools and Libraries:**

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: Visualization creation.
Seaborn: Statistical graphics.

**Visualizations:**

CO2 Emissions Distribution: Histogram showing CO2 emissions distribution.
Fuel Efficiency Distribution: Histogram of fuel efficiency in miles per gallon.
Engine Displacement Distribution: Histogram of engine displacement.
Correlation Heatmap: Heatmap illustrating correlations between numeric variables.
Additional Analysis: Includes pair plots, boxplots, and other visualizations for in-depth analysis.
